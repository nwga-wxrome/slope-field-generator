# Slope Field Generator

This project is a Python script for generating slope fields, which are graphical representations of differential equations. Slope fields are useful for visualizing solutions to first-order differential equations and are commonly used in mathematics and engineering.

## Features
- Generate slope fields for user-defined differential equations
- Customizable grid size and range
- Adjustable vector length and density
- Simple and easy-to-use interface

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib (for plotting)
- NumPy (for calculations)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/nwga-wxrome/slope-field-generator.git
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```powershell
   pip install matplotlib numpy
   ```

## Usage
Run the script using Python:
```powershell
python slope_field_generator.py
```

You will be prompted to enter the differential equation and other parameters. The script will display the slope field using Matplotlib.

## Example
For the equation dy/dx = x + y, enter:
```
x + y
```
