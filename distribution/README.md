# Slope Field Generator

A user-friendly interactive tool for visualizing and exploring slope fields (direction fields) of first-order differential equations.

## Features

- Interactive graphical interface for slope field visualization
- Real-time function updates
- Adjustable plot parameters (x-range, y-range, grid density)
- Dark mode support
- Mathematical expression parsing with support for common functions
- High-quality vector graphics output
- Customizable grid density for detailed visualizations

## Installation

No installation required! Simply download and run the executable file.

### System Requirements

- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- Minimum 4GB RAM recommended
- Screen resolution: 1024x768 or higher

## Usage

1. Run the `slope_field_generator.exe` file
2. The default function is `-cos(x)`
3. Use the interface to:
   - Change the function using the "Change Function" button
   - Adjust plot ranges and grid density
   - Toggle dark mode for better visibility
   - Update the plot with new settings

### Input Format

- Use standard mathematical notation
- Available functions: sin, cos, tan, exp, log, sqrt
- Variables: x, y
- Examples:
  - `-cos(x)`
  - `y`
  - `x*y`
  - `sin(x) + y`
  - `exp(-x)`

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Window doesn't appear**: Ensure no other instances are running
2. **Function not updating**: Check your mathematical expression syntax
3. **Display issues**: Try toggling dark mode or adjusting window size
